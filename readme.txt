We're just getting started with what can be done with DataTables. We'll have much more cool stuff like [DataTables Extensions](http://datatables.net/extensions/index).
* Added: "Add All Fields" option to bottom of the "Add Field" selector

* Fixed: Settings "gear" not showing when adding a new field
* Fixed: Sorting issues
	- Remove the option to sort by composite fields like Name, Address, Product; Gravity Forms doesn't process those sort requests properly
	- Remove List and Paragraph fields from being sortable
	- Known bug: Price fields are sorted alphabetically, not numerically. For example, given $20,000, $2,000 and $20, Gravity Forms will sort the array like this: $2,000, $20, $20,000. We've filed a bug report with Gravity Forms.
* Improved: Added visibility toggles to some Field Settings. For example, if the "Show Label" setting is not checked, then the "Custom Label" setting is hidden.
* Modified how data is sent to the template: removed the magic methods getter/setters setting the `$var` variable - not data is stored directly as object parameters.
* Added many translations. Thanks everyone!
