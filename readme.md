============

GravityView is a commercial plugin available from [https://gravityview.co](http://gravityview.co). The plugin is hosted here on a public Github repository in order to better faciliate community contributions from developers and users. If you have a suggestion, a bug report, or a patch for an issue, feel free to submit it here. 

We do ask, however, that if you are using the plugin on a live site that you please purchase a valid license from the [website](https://gravityview.co/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=readme). We cannot provide support to anyone that does not hold a valid license key.
